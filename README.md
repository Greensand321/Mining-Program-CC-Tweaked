# Mining Program CC Tweaked

This repository contains Lua scripts for the [CC: Tweaked](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked) mod for Minecraft. The programs automate various mining tasks using turtles.

## Included Programs

- `dig.lua` – simple branch mining script.
- `flex.lua` – flexible mining program with configurable parameters.
- `quarry.lua` – digs out a square quarry.
- `receive.lua` – handles communications for turtle operations.
- `stairs.lua` – digs a staircase into the ground.

These scripts are intended to be run on ComputerCraft turtles within the CC: Tweaked environment.
